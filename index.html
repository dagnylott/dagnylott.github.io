                Mechanical Engineering at the University of Pennslyvania. When
                I'm not in one of the engineering buildings, I'm probably
                practicing with the Women's Ultimate Frisbee team or setting up my
                hammock on the campus lawn. I am currently taking the year
                off from school to explore engineering and gain real-world
                experience outside of class.

                <p class = project-description>In the spring, the Washington
                Post released a <a class = in-text-link href =
                "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/"
                target = "_blank">model</a> that measured the effect of social
                distancing on the spread of COVID-19. Although their model did
                not have any scientific importance, I thought it did a great job
                of conveying the enormous impact social distancing can have on
                flattening the curve. My model mimicked the Post's ball
                simulation and graphs. The Matlab skills that I used to do this
                were: modeling particle dynamics, graphics, real-time animation,
                user interaction, and data analysis. I also learned how to
                create buttons and callback functions.
                <br> 
                <br>
                The main difference between my model and the Washington Post's
                is that the user can adjust two parameters, giving the user a
                lot more information and the ability to recreate a new scenario
                each time. For context, a Gallup poll at the end of April
                reported that approximately 80% of the U.S. population were
                following the social distancing guidlines. One could have
                included additional testing parameters such as the number of
                tests administered, when the country started testing, and
                whether testing was random or targeted.

                        clear acrylic for the horse's body and MDF for the base. The
                        horse has three types of joints: press fittings, single-lap
                        joints, and two t-nut/tab & slot connections.

                    <p class = side-description3> In the same course, I used
                    SolidWorks to CAD a model of a soap dispenser. I took apart
                    the dispenser and recorded basic measurements to ensure
                    the proportions were right. I also incorporated the motion of the
                    spring in my model (the video shown on the left is a
                    SolidWorks animation).

                    This class was extremely helpful when it came to learning
                    the basics of SolidWorks, Laser Cutting, and 3D printing.
                    Since then, I have gained a lot of experience with
                    SolidWorks during my 16-week internship at Temple Allen
                    Industries and I feel comfortable with large assembly
                    models. The projects that I completed at my internship have not been
                    released to the public yet so they won't be showcased here, but I
                    would love to talk about them in some capacity.

                <h2 class = mini-section-header>Water Show</h2>
                <p class = project-description>In the summer of 2017 and 2018 I directed my
                local pool's Water Show â€“ an annual theatrical play in and
                around the pool. Yes, that means wet costumes, choreographed
                scenes with kickboards and noodles, splashing, and of course
                more splashing! The first show was Robin
                Hood followed by Mulan: both experiences were as equally challenging
                as they were rewarding. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I typically opened sign-ups for pool members in mid-June and
                started developing the choreographed scenes. In early July, I
                began leading multiple practices a week (one for each group of
                8-10 kids) and if the kids were lucky we would wrap up the day with
                popsicles. As practices continued, I wrote the script,
                selected a playlist, designed costumes, purchased props, constructed
                the set, and got lifeguards to join the cast. All of
                these components came together in the last week of July
                for two dress rehearsals and the final show. 
                <br>
                <br>
                At the time, I knew I was gaining leadership experience
                but it felt like none of the skills I was learning would ever
                help me in a future engineering job. I was wrong â€“ it required
                the same type of problem solving. I liked to envision the
                final stage (the product) with the characters acting out the
                scenes (the assembly steps).

                    I was introduced to photography during sophomore year of
                    highschool in Visual Communications class. My teacher asked
                    another student and myself to take pictures of our high
                    school graduation ceremonies and the band's performance at
                    the Eagles Half Time Show. Later, he awarded us with varsity arts
                    letters during my junior and senior year.

                <p>The editor of my local newspaper, <a class = in-text-link
                href = "https://www.swarthmorean.com/" target = "_blank"><i>The
                Swarthmorean</i></a>, liked my graduation photos and decided to
                publish them. He asked if I would like to run their Floating
                Photographer column, which had been my favorite section to read
                in the newspaper so I quickly jumped on the offer. Usually, one
                of us would choose a question and then I would walk around the
                town center to collect responses. I really enjoyed talking to
                people, of all ages and backgrounds, who I would not have met
                otherwise. I haven't been doing any "official" photography
                recently but I'm planning on pitching a similar column to the
                UPenn newspaper when I return. </p>
